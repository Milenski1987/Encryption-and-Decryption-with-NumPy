## The project uses linear algebra to encrypt and decrypt messages using matrix operations. It is a simple symmetric cryptographic algorithm that can illustrate the basics of matrix cryptography.

🛠 Project Features:  
✅ Encryption of text by multiplication with a key matrix  
✅ Decryption of text by inverse matrix  
✅ Working with ASCII values to represent characters as matrices  
✅ Possibility for different encryption keys

📌 How does it work?
1. Convert text to numbers (ASCII codes).
2. Group numbers into a matrix (for example, 3 characters per row).
3. Multiply by a "key matrix" (for encryption).
4. Save the result as ciphertext.
5. Decrypt using the inverse matrix (applying `A⁻¹`).
